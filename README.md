# Reinforcement Learning Notes

My notes on reinforcement learning

## Doing (2017-10-26)

- [ ] DQN


### Done

- [x] Gradients, and REINFORCE algorithm
- [x] Get MuJoCo
- [x] setup OpenAI Gym on AWS (yay!:confetti_ball:)
- [x] install `MuJoCo` :confetti_ball:
- [x] install `mujoco-py` (need to upgrade to 1.50 now supports python 3.6)
- [x] make a list of concepts to keep track of
- [x] policy gradients

### Backlog

- [ ] TRPO
- [ ] A3C
- [ ] Behavior Cloning
- [ ] DAgger


### On How to Ask for Help
I found textbook to be the most reliable source, but there is usually too much material. So the best way to ask for guidance seem to be:
> I'm reading Chapter xx and topic xx atm, what are the key things I should pay attention to?

### Reference Readings

- [ ] David Silver's RL course [index](david%20silver%20RL%20course/course%20index.md)

- [ ] [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.05254.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.05254.pdf) is a longer explanation of different viewpoints for taking derivatives.Â

## Research Ideas

- Curiosity as reward
- Finding answers as reward
- inferring intention
- Learning to predict (lots of prior art. self-supervision)
- Auxiliary supervision and Auxiliary modalities.
- inverse reinforcement learning != imitation learning
