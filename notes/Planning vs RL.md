# Planning Vs Reinforcement Learning

Both under `sequential decision making`.

## Reinforcement Learning

- The environment is initially unknown
- The agent interacts with the environment
- The agent improves its policy

## Planning:

- A model of the environment is known
- The agent performs computations with its model (without any external interaction)
- The agent improves its policy
- a.k.a. deliberation, reasoning, introspection, pondering, thought, search
