# Control Variable Method (Control Variates)


Funny enough, this is also the basis of how you hedge stock purchases. 

For a random variable X with an expected value $\mu$, you can take another random variable T with expected value t, 
and construct a new variable:
$$
C = X + c (T - t).
$$
The original random variable X is an unbiased estimator of $\mu$. Now we have just created a new unbiased 
estimator of $\mu$ $C$. 

The variance of $C$ is
